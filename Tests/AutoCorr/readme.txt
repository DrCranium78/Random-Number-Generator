
 - The program acdist.c prepares a datafile consisting af 10 000 datapoints, each representing the autocorrelation lag 1
   of a dataset of 400 numbers generated by the random number generator.
   
 - The program ac_dist.m is a MAtLab program that reads and plots a histogram of the data prepared by the previous program. 
 
 - The program autocorr.c tales a sequence of 400 numbers, drawn by the random number generator, computes
   the correlations between a number and 20 sequential observations, performs a hypothesis on each coefficient
   and presents the tests in a table.
